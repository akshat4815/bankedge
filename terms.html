By enrolling in the program, the Participant explicitly agrees to comply with and be bound by all terms and conditions set forth herein. The Participant acknowledges that they have read, understood, and voluntarily entered into this Agreement, which is intended to create legally enforceable rights and obligations.
                    
                    The Participant agrees to adhere to all rules, regulations, policies, and procedures as established and periodically amended by the Institution. This includes, but is not limited to, the timely and complete submission of all assignments, active participation in all program-related activities, attendance at scheduled classes and sessions, and full compliance with any and all assessments, examinations, or evaluations administered by the Institution. The Participant understands that these obligations are critical to their successful completion of the program and that failure to meet any of these obligations may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to the forfeiture of any and all guarantees or assurances provided by the Institution, up to and including termination from the program without refund or compensation.
                    
                    The Institution offers a placement guarantee to Participants who maintain a minimum attendance level of seventy percent (70%) throughout the entire duration of the program. This placement guarantee is contingent upon the Participant’s strict adherence to all program requirements, including but not limited to the successful completion of all coursework, assessments, and any additional tasks as determined by the Institution. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the placement guarantee is a conditional offer, subject to the Participant's performance, conduct, and attendance. Should the Participant fail to meet the seventy percent (70%) attendance threshold or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations under this Agreement, the Institution reserves the right to unilaterally revoke the placement guarantee, without incurring any liability to the Participant.</p>
                    <p>The placement guarantee provided by the Institution is strictly limited to job roles and opportunities within the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance ("BFSI") sector. The Institution makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee, express or implied, as to the specific nature, location, compensation, or duration of the placement. The Institution further reserves the exclusive right to determine the suitability of the Participant for any placement opportunity, based on their performance during the program, their qualifications, and the needs of the potential employers. The Participant acknowledges that the Institution's role is to facilitate introductions to potential employers, and the Institution shall not be held responsible for any employment decisions made by such employers.</p>
                    <p>The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement apply exclusively to the BankEdge Lucknow branch and are not transferable or applicable to any other branch, office, or affiliate of the BankEdge organization. All offers, programs, guarantees, and representations made herein are confined to the BankEdge Lucknow branch and do not extend to any other BankEdge branches or affiliates within India or beyond. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that they are engaging with BankEdge Lucknow exclusively and that any representations made by other branches or affiliates of the Institution do not apply to their engagement with BankEdge Lucknow.</p>
                    <p>The Institution retains the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to modify, amend, supplement, or terminate any of its programs, policies, procedures, or this Agreement in whole or in part at any time, with or without prior notice to the Participant. Such modifications or amendments shall become effective immediately upon being communicated to the Participant or upon their publication on the official BankEdge Lucknow website. The Participant agrees to regularly review the terms and conditions of this Agreement and acknowledges that their continued participation in the program constitutes their acceptance of any such modifications or amendments. The Participant further acknowledges that it is their responsibility to remain informed of any changes and to comply with the updated terms and conditions.</p>
                    <p>In no event shall the Institution, its parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, or licensors be liable to the Participant or any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive, or other damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of or related to the Participant’s enrollment in the program, participation in the placement process, use of the Institution’s website, or reliance on any information provided by the Institution, even if the Institution has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged damages arise from breach of contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory.</p>
                    <p>The Participant agrees that all materials, content, and information provided by the Institution, including but not limited to educational materials, course content, website content, promotional materials, and any other intellectual property, are the exclusive property of the Institution or its content suppliers and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including but not limited to copyright, trademark, and patent laws. The Participant agrees not to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any such materials, content, or information, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Institution. Unauthorized use of any materials, content, or information provided by the Institution may result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including but not limited to injunctive relief and damages.</p>
                    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The Participant agrees that any and all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its formation, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The seat of arbitration shall be Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
                    <p>The Participant acknowledges and agrees that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Participant's engagement with the Institution shall be instituted exclusively in the courts located in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and the Participant irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The Participant further waives any objection to the venue of any such action, suit, or proceeding in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and agrees not to plead or claim that such action, suit, or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>
                    <p>The Participant agrees that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Participant and the Institution with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations, or communications, whether oral or written, relating to such subject matter. The Participant acknowledges that no representation or warranty, oral or written, has been made to induce the Participant to enter into this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. The Participant agrees that any modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if made in writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties.</p>
                    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties.</p>
                    <p>The Participant agrees that the Institution's failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any right or provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of the Institution.</p>
                    <p>In witness whereof, the Participant has executed this Agreement as of the date of their enrollment in the program, signifying their acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions contained herein. The Participant acknowledges that they have had the opportunity to seek independent legal advice before entering into this Agreement and that they are entering into this Agreement voluntarily, with a full understanding of its terms and conditions.</p>
